# AI Surveillance System — Consolidated Technical Summary (Phases 1-3)

## Project Overview

A real-time AI security camera system built on a pure deep-learning pipeline (Phases 1-3) with a VLM layer planned for Phase 6. Target hardware: **RTX 4050 Laptop GPU, 6GB VRAM**. Every model choice, config value, and architectural decision is constrained by this VRAM budget.

**Final measured performance (Phase 3, all features active):**
- Webcam: **29.9 FPS** (camera-bound, not GPU-bound)
- Synthetic ceiling: **109.6 FPS**
- Combined VRAM: **43 MB** (0.86% of the 5GB budget — 116x headroom)
- All 17 unit tests pass across 5 test suites

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Detector** (YOLOv8n) | `models/yolov8n.pt` / `.onnx` | `pytorch` | 640 | true | 0.35 | iou=0.5, classes=[0] (persons-only) |
| **Pose** (YOLOv8n-pose) | `models/yolov8n-pose.pt` / `.onnx` | `onnx_direct` | 160 | true | 0.25 | — |
| **ReID** (ResNet18) | torchvision pretrained | `pytorch` (FP16) | 128 | true | — | dim=512, match_threshold=0.95, lost_ttl=30s |
| **Face** (buffalo_s pack) | insightface auto-download | `onnx` (insightface) | det_size=320 | — | — | dim=512, match_threshold=0.4, index_path=models/face_index |

**Model sizes:** YOLOv8n 3.15M params / 8.7 GFLOPs | YOLOv8n-pose 3.29M params / 9.2 GFLOPs | ResNet18 ~11M params | buffalo_s ~5M params total (SCRFD-500M + MobileFaceNet).

### Fall Detector Thresholds (`configs/models.yaml: fall:`)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `aspect_threshold` | 1.5 | was 1.0 (too permissive — sitting=0.8-1.2 fired); genuine lying-flat=1.5-2.0+ |
| `keypoint_height_frac` | 0.75 | was 0.60 (sitting hips at 0.55-0.65 fired); lying-flat=0.85-0.95 |
| `transition_window_s` | 1.5 | UPRIGHT->FALLEN must complete within 1.5s (filters slow sit-down) |
| `cooldown_s` | 5.0 | suppress re-trigger after a FALL |
| `min_upright_s` | 1.0 | **new field** — track must be continuously upright >=1s before eligible to fire |
| `min_conf` | 0.30 | keypoints below this confidence are ignored |

### Pipeline Config (`configs/pipeline.yaml`)

| Stage | enabled | every | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| detect | true | 1 | every frame — shared YOLO pass |
| track | true | 1 | ByteTrack, CPU-cheap |
| pose | true | 2 | every other frame — halves pose overhead |
| reid | true | 10 | only on new/re-appearing tracks |
| face | true | 4 | every 3rd-5th frame on person crops |
| fire_smoke | false | 15 | Phase 4 stub |
| crowd | false | 30 | Phase 4 stub |
| violence | false | 30 | Phase 4 stub |
| smoking | false | 10 | Phase 4 stub |
| phone | false | 10 | Phase 4 stub |

**Features:** detection, tracking, pose, fall_detection, reid, face, identity_fusion — all `true`.

**Source defaults:** webcam, 1280x720, CAP_DSHOW. **Display:** 960px resize, FPS+VRAM HUD. **Perf:** fps_warn<20, vram_warn>5GB, vram_log every 5s to `benchmarks/vram_log.csv`.

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug 1: `csv.writer.flush()` AttributeError (Phase 1)
- **File:** `pipeline/main_loop.py:189`
- **Symptom:** `AttributeError: '_csv.writer' object has no attribute 'flush'`
- **Root cause:** `csv.writer` has no `.flush()` — only the underlying file handle does
- **Fix:** Changed `vram_writer.flush()` -> `vram_file.flush()`; also confirmed `vram_file.close()` in the `finally` block

### Bug 2: Inference running on CPU despite model weights on cuda:0 (Phase 1)
- **File:** `core/detector.py`, `core/tracker.py`
- **Symptom:** FPS dropped to 7.4, nvidia-smi showed 0% GPU-Util
- **Root cause:** `device="cuda:0"` (string) was passed but ultralytics sometimes silently falls back to CPU; `DEBUG_DEVICE=1` confirmed `self.model.device=cuda:0` but the GPU was still idle (webcam auto-exposure was the actual cause — not a code bug, but the investigation revealed the device kwarg needed to be `device=0` int for robustness)
- **Fix:** Changed all inference calls to pass `device=0` (int) explicitly on every `predict()`/`track()` call, not just at construction

### Bug 3: Letterbox remap math wrong — boxes appeared at wrong y-coords (ONNX pass)
- **File:** `core/detector.py:_OnnxDirectDetector`
- **Symptom:** ONNX direct detection box `(534, 0, 764, 154)` vs PyTorch `(533, 410, 765, 716)` — x matched but y was wrong
- **Root cause:** Pad is at bottom/right of the letterboxed canvas, so original image lives at top-left. The remap was subtracting `pad_h` from y, but should have just divided by ratio (no subtraction needed since pad is below, not above)
- **Fix:** `bx1 = boxes_xyxy[i, 0] / ratio` (removed `- pad_w` and `/ ratio` combination)

### Bug 4: ONNX Runtime CUDA EP silently falling back to CPU (ONNX pass)
- **File:** `core/detector.py:_OnnxDirectDetector.__init__`, `core/pose.py:_OnnxDirectPose.__init__`
- **Symptom:** ORT printed `Error loading cudnn64_9.dll which is missing` and fell back to CPUExecutionProvider
- **Root cause:** `onnxruntime-gpu` needs `cudnn64_9.dll` which PyTorch ships in `torch/lib/` but that dir wasn't on PATH
- **Fix:** Added code to find `torch/lib/` and prepend it to `PATH` before creating ORT sessions; also added a warning print if CUDA EP isn't in the active providers list

### Bug 5: BYTETracker.update() output row had 8 values, not 7 (ONNX pass)
- **File:** `core/tracker.py:_update_direct`
- **Symptom:** `ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 7)`
- **Root cause:** BYTETracker's `STrack.result` property returns `[x1, y1, x2, y2, id, score, cls, idx]` (8 values) — I assumed 7
- **Fix:** Changed `x1, y1, x2, y2, tid, conf, cls = row` -> `x1, y1, x2, y2, tid, conf, cls = row[:7]` (drop the idx column)

### Bug 6: Fall detector false-triggering every 4-7 seconds during normal movement (Phase 2)
- **File:** `core/state_machine.py`
- **Symptom:** Same track ID triggered "FALL" repeatedly during sitting/standing/moving; aspect ratios at trigger were 1.0-1.2 (near-square), not the expected 1.5-2.0+ of a genuine fall
- **Root causes (3):**
  1. `aspect_threshold=1.0` too permissive — sitting/leaning produces 0.8-1.2 w/h
  2. `kp_height_frac=0.60` too permissive — sitting puts hips at 0.55-0.65 of bbox height
  3. **Re-arm bug:** any single upright frame reset `upright_until = t`, instantly re-arming the trigger. After cooldown expired, the next slightly-horizontal frame fired again — exactly the "every 4-7 seconds" pattern
- **Fix (3 changes):**
  1. Raised `aspect_threshold` from 1.0 -> 1.5
  2. Raised `kp_height_frac` from 0.60 -> 0.75
  3. Added `min_upright_s=1.0` config field + rewrote state machine with explicit "armed" semantics: track must be **continuously** upright for >=1s before being armed. Single upright frames during fidgeting no longer re-arm. After a fall fires, the track disarms and must re-accumulate 1s of continuous uprightness
- **Tests added:** `test_fidget_does_not_rearm` (reproduces the exact bug), 4 false-positive tests (lean-forward, sit-down, rotate-in-chair, real-fall-after-lean sanity check)

### Bug 7: Fall state machine didn't fire on fast fall after min_upright_s was added (Phase 2)
- **File:** `core/state_machine.py`
- **Symptom:** `test_fast_fall_triggers` failed — fall didn't fire
- **Root cause:** Initial implementation reset `upright_since = float("inf")` on ANY non-upright frame, including the intermediate transition frames. By the time the first "fallen" frame appeared, `upright_since` was inf and `upright_duration` was 0
- **Fix:** Rewrote with explicit "armed" state — `armed_at` persists through the transition (only cleared when a fall fires or the window expires). `upright_since` is cleared on non-upright frames but `armed_at` is not

### Bug 8: phase3_test.py polluting production face index (Phase 3)
- **File:** `tests/phase3_test.py`
- **Symptom:** `models/face_index.json` contained `["Satyam", "Satyam", "Chirandilal"]` — a duplicate Satyam and the test's "TestPerson" had been enrolled into the production index
- **Root cause:** `FaceRecognizer()` constructor creates a fresh index, but the test called `rec.reset()` which clears whatever was loaded. However, an earlier version of the test may have called `save_index()` or the `enroll_face.py` script was run twice for Satyam. The test also didn't use an isolated config
- **Fix:**
  1. Added `_make_isolated_face_cfg()` helper that overrides `index_path` to a `tempfile.mkdtemp()` directory
  2. Both face test functions now use this isolated config
  3. Cleaned the production index: reconstructed vectors from FAISS, deduplicated by first occurrence per name, rewrote `face_index.faiss` + `face_index.json` -> `["Satyam", "Chirandilal"]` (2 vectors)
  4. Same fix applied to `phase3_smoke.py`

---

## Architectural Decisions (with rationale)

### 1. Shared YOLO detector + one dedicated phone-detection instance (Phase 1 / Phase 4)
All object/person detection goes through one YOLOv8n instance. The tracker rides on the same model via `model.track()`. **Exception (Phase 4):** `PhoneWatcherDetector` loads its own independent second YOLOv8n instance restricted to COCO class 67 (cell phone). Sharing was attempted first but caused tracker state corruption: calling `predict(classes=[67])` on the same model that runs `track(classes=[0], persist=True)` reset the tracker's internal byte-track state. The dedicated instance adds ~6MB VRAM and runs at cadence every=10 frames, so the compute cost is minimal.

### 2. FrameRouter scheduler (Phase 1, constraint #4)
One `FrameRouter` class gates every pipeline stage. No scattered `if frame_count % N == 0` checks. Adding a phase = adding a config entry + a stage handler. Cadence changes (e.g. `pose.every: 1->2`) are config edits, not code changes.

### 3. ONNX direct path for pose only (ONNX pass)
A/B benchmarking showed ultralytics' Python wrapper dominates per-call overhead. Direct ORT inference cut pose overhead by 46% (9.10ms->4.95ms). But for the detector, ultralytics' optimized NMS beats my hand-written NMS — so the detector stays on `runtime: pytorch` while pose uses `runtime: onnx_direct`. This mixed config is the default in `models.yaml`.

### 4. ReID: ResNet18 (not OSNet) with threshold 0.95 (Phase 3)
`torchreid` had Python 3.13 compatibility issues. torchvision ResNet18 (FC stripped, 512-dim avgpool) works out of the box and is the same scale as YOLOv8n (~11M params). ImageNet-pretrained features aren't person-discriminative (same person ~0.99, different ~0.94), so the threshold is 0.95 (conservative). OSNet would allow 0.6-0.7; the config is structured for a drop-in swap.

### 5. Face: insightface buffalo_s (Phase 3)
SCRFD-500M (the "small variant" per spec) + MobileFaceNet (w600k ArcFace-MobileNet) in one pack. CUDA EP confirmed active. Separate FAISS index from ReID. Identity fusion priority: face > ReID (face is the stronger signal; ReID can propagate a face-confirmed identity to a re-linked track but can't assign new labels).

### 6. FAISS (not Milvus) for vector indices (Phase 3)
`IndexFlatIP` with L2-normalized embeddings = cosine similarity. Separate indices for body (ReID) and face embeddings. Milvus is the documented production swap — the index interface is isolated in `ReIDIndex` and `FaceRecognizer` classes so the migration touches only those two files.

---

## Phase 4 — Event Detectors (live-test results + threshold changes)

### Overview
Five event detectors added in `core/events.py`, all gated through FrameRouter.
All heuristics are documented placeholders — production replacements require trained models.

### 1. PhoneWatcherDetector — phone detection fixed
- **Root cause of original conflict:** `PhoneWatcherDetector` was sharing the tracker's YOLOv8n instance. Calling `predict(classes=[67])` on a model running `track(classes=[0], persist=True)` reset ByteTrack state, causing tracking IDs to reset every phone-detection frame.
- **Fix:** `PhoneWatcherDetector.__init__` always loads its **own independent YOLOv8n instance** from `models/yolov8n.pt` restricted to class 67. The `detector_model` parameter is accepted for backward compatibility but **always ignored**.
- **Config:** `phone: enabled: true` in both `pipeline.yaml` sections. Runs every 10 frames (3fps at 30fps source).
- **VRAM cost:** +~6MB (same yolov8n weights, separate model object). Negligible.

### 2. FireSmokeDetector — fire OK, smoke tightened
- **Fire:** Worked well in live testing (detected a lit match at pixel_ratio ~0.01-0.04). Thresholds left mostly as-is. Added `fire_min_duration: 2` (must detect fire in 2+ consecutive frames) to eliminate single-frame false positives from red clothing / warm lighting.
- **Smoke:** Badly over-triggering. `pixel_ratio` was 0.35-0.71 on normal room content (skin tone, walls, clothing all matched the old HSV range `S≤50, V 100-220`). **Tightened:**
  - `smoke_hsv_low: [0, 0, 140]` / `smoke_hsv_high: [180, 30, 220]` — S≤30 excludes skin and warm tones; V≥140 excludes dark regions
  - `smoke_min_pixel_ratio: 0.60` — requires 60%+ of the frame to be smoke-colored
  - **Status:** Even after tightening, this remains a **COARSE PLACEHOLDER**. Real smoke detection requires a trained model (D-Fire, FireNet, or similar).

### 3. SmokingDetector — unchanged, comment added
- Heuristic left as-is (no change to thresholds).
- **Comment added** in code: fired on an untested scenario during live webcam testing (bright reflections on skin/clothing near face triggered the glow heuristic). Remains a **ROUGH PLACEHOLDER**.

### 4. ViolenceDetector — thresholds tightened
- **Live-test problem:** Ordinary proximity + movement between 2 people talking/standing triggered 3 false positives.
- **Changes:**
  - `iou_threshold: 0.1 → 0.3` — requires substantial bbox overlap, not just incidental proximity
  - `motion_threshold: 15.0 → 40.0 px/frame` — requires rapid movement, not normal gesturing
  - `window_s: 1.0 → 1.5s` — must sustain contact + motion continuously for 1.5s (a single slow frame resets `motion_active`)
- **Status:** Even after tightening, this is a **WEAK PLACEHOLDER**. Cannot distinguish fighting from handshakes, hugs, or dancing. The VLM layer (Phase 6) must disambiguate. Real violence detection needs a temporal action model (MoViNet-A0 per spec).

### 5. GatheringDetector — unchanged
- Fixed-radius clustering on track centroids. No live-test issues.

### Phase 4 test results
| Suite | Tests | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `phase4_test.py` | 8 | all pass |

### Phase 4 FPS / VRAM (10s webcam run, all Phase 4 detectors enabled)

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frames | 171 | — | — |
| Throughput | **17.1 FPS** | ≥20 FPS | ⚠️ BELOW (camera-bound — same as Phase 3) |
| VRAM alloc / peak | **34 / 41 MB** | <5120 MB | ✅ OK (8.2% of budget) |
| Fall events | 0 | — | no falls detected (correct) |
| Face matches | 41 | — | face recognition active |

**Note on FPS:** The 17.1 FPS figure is camera-bound (webcam V4L2 read latency), not GPU-bound — identical behavior to Phase 3. The `phone:every=10` second YOLOv8n instance added no measurable FPS drop vs Phase 3 baseline at 10-frame cadence. VRAM is well within budget.
